#Spring meet-up
##Short talks
###Jonathan Carroll
Got lots of loops or repetitive calculating to do? In this talk I'll walk through the basics of synchronous vs asynchronous processing and demonstrate some ways to perform calculations in parallel (or offsite) based on the {future} package.

###Kristen Osborne
Putting R in the internet tubes; An introduction to blogdown! Blogdown is an R package that lets you create websites from R Markdown documents, making it easy to put your R code and outputs online. It creates a static website you can host on any server with minimal effort. In this talk we'll cover what blogdown is and why you might want to use it, look at some easy ways to get started, and share resources to take you further. 

###Rachel Searston


###Rory Tarnow-Mordi
Sometimes our datasets are just too darn big. In this talk we'll look at using SparkR to spread our data and data transformations over a cluster of machines.
